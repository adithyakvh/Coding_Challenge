The provided code is a Python implementation of a problem-solving algorithm called "ThiefsAndCops." It appears to be a simulation of cops and thieves on a grid-based environment, where the goal is to find the closest safe grid for the thief while considering the field of view (FoV) of the cops.

Here is the documentation for the code:

### ThiefsAndCops Class

#### `__init__(self, grid: np.ndarray, orientations: np.ndarray, fov: np.ndarray) -> None`
- Initializes the ThiefsAndCops object.
- Parameters:
  - `grid`: A 2D NumPy array representing the grid environment. Positive values represent cop positions, 0 represents safe grids, and negative values represent the thief's position.
  - `orientations`: A 1D NumPy array containing the orientations of the cops in degrees.
  - `fov`: A 1D NumPy array containing the field of view (FoV) angles in degrees for the cops.

#### `_make_grid(self) -> None`
- Initializes the gridX and gridY matrices for processing.

#### `findClosestSafeGrid(self) -> Tuple[List, List]`
- Finds the closest safe grid for the thief while considering the field of view (FoV) of the cops.
- Returns:
  - A tuple containing:
    - `cop_ids`: A list of cop IDs (indices) that can see the thief.
    - `closest_safe_grid`: A list containing the coordinates of the closest safe grid.

#### `visualize(self) -> None`
- Visualizes the grid environment and the results.
- Displays a plot showing the grid, with different colors representing different elements such as safe grids, cops, thief, visible grids, closest safe grid, etc.

#### `_start_timer(self) -> None`
- Starts the timer for measuring the execution time of the algorithm.

#### `_stop_timer(self) -> None`
- Stops the timer and calculates the execution time of the algorithm.

### main Function
- The main function demonstrates the usage of the ThiefsAndCops class.
- It creates an instance of the ThiefsAndCops class with a sample grid, orientations, and field of view.
- Calls the `findClosestSafeGrid` method to calculate the closest safe grid for the thief.
- Calls the `visualize` method to visualize the grid and the results.
- Prints the execution time, cops watching the thief, and the closest safe grid.
